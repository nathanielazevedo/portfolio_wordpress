Embed YouTube videos without slowing down your site.

== Description ==

The default embed block for Youtube videos sucks. It slows down your site. The more videos on the page the more it slow. This single-block plugin fixes that.

Why this block is better than the default one:

* Instead of loading the entire iframe, only the video thumbnail is loaded, resulting in significant performance improvements
* Automatically load the video title as the caption
* The same UI as the default core/embed, and you can use the video title as the caption of the block with one click
* It can be transformed from/to the core embed block.

Please check out this [page](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/video-tutorials/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=BYEB) to see how fast it helps. The page contains around 30 embedded Youtube videos but they don't slow down the page.
